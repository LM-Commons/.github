# LM-Commons 

LM-Commons is a GitHub organization dedicated to the collaborative 
and community-driven long-term maintenance of packages & libraries based on the Laminas MVC, Components and Mezzio.

Many of the packages found in the LM-Commons repositories are former ZF-Commons packages
that were migrated to the Laminas Project framework.

Official documentation can be found at [lm-commons.github.io](https://lm-commons.github.io)

### Announcements

#### Sunsetting of LMC MVC based components

With the recent announcement from the Laminas Project to sunset the Laminas MVC framework, the LMC components that are related to MVC will be sunset as well. Details can be found in this [blog](https://lm-commons.github.io/blog/MVC-maintenance-only/) post.

### Roadmap

LM-Commons is in constant evolution. Many of the packages are 
legacy ZF-Commons that are old, outdated and are in need of major upgrades.

The [Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md) describes the direction we want to take for different packages.

If you have a question or a comment on the Roadmap, please create an [issue](https://github.com/LM-Commons/.github/issues).

#### New packages

We are open to integrate new packages into LM-Commons. Please submit a proposal as an issue [here](https://github.com/LM-Commons/.github/issues).
